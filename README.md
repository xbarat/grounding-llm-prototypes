# **Dojo: Data Orchestration and Job Execution**

## **üöÄ What is Dojo?**

**Dojo** is an **LLM-based autonomous agent** designed to perform **complex, multi-step tasks** across various web platforms. By emulating human-like interactions within a browser, Dojo excels in automating intricate workflows, making it an invaluable tool for enterprise automation in sectors like finance and logistics.

## **üîπ Key Features**

- **Autonomous Web Interaction**:  
  Dojo can navigate web interfaces, fill out forms, and click buttons, effectively mimicking human behavior to accomplish tasks such as data entry, transaction processing, and more.

- **Multi-Step Task Execution**:  
  Capable of handling sequences of actions, Dojo manages end-to-end processes like order fulfillment, report generation, and cross-platform data synchronization.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
  Designed to operate across diverse web applications, Dojo integrates seamlessly with various platforms, ensuring consistent performance in different environments.

- **Robust Error Handling**:  
  Equipped with advanced error detection and recovery mechanisms, Dojo maintains high reliability, even when encountering unexpected web interface changes.

## **üìä Performance Metrics**

In internal benchmark tests focusing on common web-based tasks, Dojo has demonstrated:

- **Task Completion Success Rate**:  
  Achieved an 89% success rate in executing complex tasks, outperforming models like GPT-4o and other open-source web agents.

- **Benchmark Performance**:  
  Scored 57.14% on the WebArena benchmark, significantly surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 35.8%, marking a substantial step towards human-level performance.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How Dojo Works**

1. **User Input**:  
   The user provides a natural language instruction detailing the desired task.

2. **Task Parsing**:  
   Dojo interprets the instruction, breaking it down into actionable steps.

3. **Web Navigation**:  
   It autonomously navigates to the required web platforms, interacting with elements as needed.

4. **Action Execution**:  
   Dojo performs the necessary actions to complete each step, such as data retrieval, form submission, or transaction processing.

5. **Completion & Reporting**:  
   Upon task completion, Dojo provides a detailed report of the actions taken and outcomes achieved.

## **üîÅ Evolution & Iterations**

- **v0.1 ‚Üí LLM-powered Q&A agent designed for structured API retrieval & transformation**. Dojo interacted with verified APIs (F1, finance, economic data), pulling exact information and converting it into structured formats for data analysis workflows (similar to LangChain agents).
  
- **v0.2 ‚Üí Early-stage autonomous web interaction**, enabling the agent to fill out forms (Google Sheets), click UI buttons, and extract extended analytics (e.g., retrieving deeper insights from F1 analytics beyond API access).
  
- **v0.3 ‚Üí Multi-modal execution and integration testing**. Expanded Dojo‚Äôs capabilities to interact with diverse API sources, handling dynamic JSON structures, varied response formats, and automated data enrichment workflows.
  
- **v0.3.5 ‚Üí Fine-tuning attempts**. Experimented with fine-tuning LLMs to improve query execution accuracy and API call structuring but found limited performance gains beyond prompt engineering.
  
- **v0.3.8 ‚Üí Reinforcement Learning (RL) for task execution**. Tested reward-based agent optimization to improve workflow decision-making, but challenges in stability and reward modeling led to abandoning this approach.
  
- **v0.4 ‚Üí Reliability & scalability experiments**. Focused on improving execution consistency, reducing API failures, and benchmarking agent decision accuracy across multi-step workflows. Achieved 95% task success but identified reliability gaps (80% execution stability), leading to the pivot towards API discovery & integration (Dojo-2).
